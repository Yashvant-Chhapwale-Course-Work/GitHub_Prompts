## What are Branches in GitHub ?
- `Branches` are **Individual Lines of Development** within a `GitHub_repository`.
- They allow you to work on `changes`, `new_features` or `bug_fixes` separately from the **Main_Codebase**.
- **Multiple** `Branches` can exist at the same time, supporting **Collaborative** and **Parallel Development**.
- **Types of Branches:**
  - **`main` (or `master`):** It is the **Main Branch** of your project. Contains the **final**, **stable** Code.
  - **`develop`:** It is used to **Combine** all **New Work** (`features`, `fixes`). **Acts** like a `Testing_Area` before updating the `main` branch.
  - **`feature`:** It is used to **Build** a **New Feature**. It is created from `develop` and merged back when done.
  - **`release`:** It is used to **Prepare** a **New Version** of the project before it's deployed. The `release` branch is merged into `main` (**for production**) and also into `develop` (**to keep future work in sync**).
  - **`hotfix`:** It is used for quickly **Fixing Urgent Issues** in the project.
