## What are Branches in GitHub ?
- `Branches` are **Individual Lines of Development** within a `GitHub_repository`.
- They allow you to work on `changes`, `new_features` or `bug_fixes` separately from the **Main_Codebase**.
- **Multiple** `Branches` can exist at the same time, supporting **Collaborative** and **Parallel Development**.
- **Types of Branches:**
  - **`main` (or `master`):** It is the **Main Branch** of your project. Contains the **final**, **stable** Code.
  - **`develop`:** It is used to **Combine** all **New Work** (`features`, `fixes`). **Acts** like a `Testing_Area` before updating the `main` branch.
  - **`feature`:** It is used to **Build** a **New Feature**. It is created from `develop` and merged back when done.
  - **`release`:** It is used to **Prepare** a **New Version** of the project before it's deployed. The `release` branch is merged into `main` (**for production**) and also into `develop` (**to keep future work in sync**).
  - **`hotfix`:** It is used for quickly **Fixing Urgent Issues** in the project.

## Create and Switch Branches [For Local Branches]
### Create a Branch:
- Open your `Terminal`.
- Paste the following **Command** in your `Terminal` to **Create a New Branch:**
  ```
  git branch BRANCH_NAME
  ```
  `Note:` Switch `BRANCH_NAME` with your desired **Branch-Name** (Ex: `main`, `develop`,etc or Other)
<br>

### Switch to a Branch:
- Open your `Terminal`.
- Paste the following **Command** in your `Terminal` to **Switch to an Existing Branch:**
  ```
  git checkout BRANCH_NAME
  ```
  `Note:` Switch `BRANCH_NAME` with your **existing Branch-Name** (Ex: `main`, `develop`,etc or Other)
<br>

###  Create and Switch to a Branch Simultaneously:
- Open your `Terminal`.
- Paste the following **Command** in your `Terminal` to **Create and Switch to a Branch Simultanoeusly:**
  ```
  git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
  ```
  The **`-b` Flag** indicates `Git` to **Create a New Branch**.<br>
  `Note:` Switch `BRANCH_NAME` with your desired **Branch-Name** (Ex: `main`, `develop`,etc or Other)  
<br>

## Create and Switch Branches [For Remote Branches]
### Create a Remote Branch:
- **Navigate** to your `Github_Repository`.
- **Click** on the `Branch Dropdown_Menu` to **Create** a `New Branch` in the Project:
  ![Branch Dropdown_Menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7910d3ca-1aa1-4a80-aa0d-c9aab3212865)<br>
- **Select** the `Branch` (`SELECTED_BRANCH`) from which you want to **Create** a `NEW_BRANCH`.
- Enter the `NEW_BRANCH_NAME` and **Click** on `Create NEW_BRANCH_NAME from SELECTED_BRANCH`:
  ![Create NEW_BRANCH from SELECTED_BRANCH](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/430db745-f33f-4495-b1e6-2cb4d2289bd5)<br>
- The **Newly Created Branch** will be displayed in the `Branch Dropdown_Menu` as follows:
  ![New Branch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95211ee7-ae29-47c7-8131-3759b838c282)<br>  
<br>

### Switching a Remote Branch:
- **Navigate** to your `Github_Repository`.
- **Click** on the `Branch Dropdown_Menu` to **View** the `Existing Branches` in the Project:
  ![Branches Dropdown_Menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ed22315-5d47-4e54-9db1-4465bbf5dec0)<br>
- **Select** the `Branch` which you want to `Switch` to.
  ![Switching the Remote Branch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cfa19db-267e-4f38-bbbf-b0043b1bb14c)<br>
- The Repository_Page now display the **Files** from the `Selected_Remote_Branch`:
  ![Selected_Remote_Branch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80087b3f-df2e-4f6e-ac8a-ddaf68748e21)<br>

## Fetching Branches
### Fetch Branches from Remote_Repository:
- Open your `Terminal`.
- Paste the following **Command** in your `Terminal` to **Fetch** all the `Branches` from a `Remote_Repository`:
  ```
  git fetch
  git branch -r
  ```
  `fetch:` This **Command** is used to **Download** the latest `commits`, `branches`, and `tags` from the `Remote_Repository` without merging or modifying your working directory.<br>
  `-r:` This **Flag** is used to **List** all `remote-tracking branches` (from `Remote_Repository`) that your `Local_Repository` knows about.
- The **Command** will display the `Remote_Branches` in the format: `origin/branch-name`
  ![git fetch>>git branch -r](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86f100ff-ffbc-41d4-9091-7b625f554f6f)<br>
  `Note:` The `fetch` **Command** fetches Updates from the `Remote_Repository`, but it doesnâ€™t automatically `prune (remove)` **References** to **Branches** that **no longer exist** on the `Remote_Repository`, from your `Local_Repository`. Hence, you may also see **References** of **Deleted** `Remote_Branches` being displayed.
<br>

### Switching a Remote Branch:
- **Navigate** to your `Github_Repository`.
- **Click** on the `Branch Dropdown_Menu` to **View** the `Existing Branches` in the Project:
  ![Branches Dropdown_Menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ed22315-5d47-4e54-9db1-4465bbf5dec0)<br>
- **Select** the `Branch` which you want to `Switch` to.
  ![Switching the Remote Branch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cfa19db-267e-4f38-bbbf-b0043b1bb14c)<br>
- The Repository_Page now display the **Files** from the `Selected_Remote_Branch`:
  ![Selected_Remote_Branch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80087b3f-df2e-4f6e-ac8a-ddaf68748e21)<br>
